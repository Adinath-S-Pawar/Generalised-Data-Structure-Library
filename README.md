# Generalised Data Structure Library

## Technology

C++ Programming

## Project Overview

This project is a C++ library of generic data structures that provides
object-oriented implementations of both linear and non-linear data
structures.
It offers ready-to-use functionalities for fundamental as well as
advanced operations, designed using templates so they can be reused with
any data type.
The library follows clean OOP principles, modularity, and extensibility,
making it suitable for academic learning and real-world applications.

## Key Features

### Linear Data Structures

-   Singly Linear Linked List
-   Singly Circular Linked List
-   Doubly Linear Linked List
-   Doubly Circular Linked List
-   Stack
-   Queue

### Non-Linear Data Structures

-   Binary Search Tree (BST)
    -   Insert
    -   Delete
    -   Traversals

### Algorithms

-   Searching Algorithms
-   Sorting Algorithms

## Generic Implementation

-   Implemented using C++ templates for full data-type independence.

## Library Format

-   Designed as a reusable C++ library that can be linked with client
    applications.
