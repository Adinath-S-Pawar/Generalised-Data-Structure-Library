Technology: C++ Programming

Project Overview
This project is a C++ library of generic data structures that provides object-oriented implementations of both linear and non-linear data structures.
It offers ready-to-use functionalities for fundamental as well as advanced operations, designed in a generic way using templates so that they can be reused with any data type.
The library is designed to support clean OOP principles, modularity, and extensibility making it suitable for both academic learning and real-world application development.

Key Features
Linear Data Structures
Singly Linear Linked List
Singly Circular Linked List
Doubly Linear Linked List
Doubly Circular Linked List
Stack 
Queue 
Non-Linear Data Structures
Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, delete, traversal operations Algorithms
Searching Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms

Generic Implementation
Uses C++ templates for data type independence.

Library Format
Designed as a reusable C++ library that can be linked with client applications
